>  __Instructions:__ You must submit this homework by pushing the "hw3.Rmd" file to your team's repo. Note that that is the __only__ file you will be allowed to push. Commit early and often.

> __Note:__ This is a continuation of HW 2. But you have new groups! You should collect what you did for HW 2 to form the first part. You can also use material from the model solution online. The bulk of the grading will focus on the new part, but this should be one coherent document.

#### Research Scenario: Predicting house prices 

People buying or selling houses would like to know how much they can expect to get, or
pay, for a property. This is also a concern for those who are making
mortgage loans, or for those taxing real estate (and who are more
likely to commission statistical studies than individual
home-owners). The price of a house depends on its physical
characteristics, including size, features, quality of construction,
age, etc. It also depends on location, and current market
characteristics. You are approached by a research group which has
data  on a sample of residential sales in a midwestern city; the 
variables are described in the table below. They would like you to fit a
multiple linear regression, with sales price as the response and (some or all of) the
other variables as predictors. 

|Variable name | Description |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales price | Sale price of house (dollars) |
| Finished square feet  |	Finished area of residence(square feet) |
| Number of bedrooms 	|	Total number of bedrooms in residence |
| Number of bathrooms | Total number of bathrooms in residence |
| Air conditioning 	|	Presence or absence of air conditioning: 1 if yes; 0 otherwise |
| Garage size	 |	 Number of cars that garage will hold	|
| Pool	|	Presence or absence of swimming pool: 1 if yes; 0 otherwise	|
| Year built	|	 Year property was originally constructed	|
| House Quality	|	1= high quality, 2 = medium, 3 = low	|
| Lot size	|	Lot size (square feet)	|
| Adjacent to highway  | 1 if the property is adjacent to a highway, 0 otherwise |

Your client believes that higher quality of construction should
predict higher prices. They also believe that older houses tend to
have lower prices, though this relationship is thought to differ
depending on whether or not the house is adjacent to a highway. They
also think that the relationship between price and finished area
differs depending on the number of bedrooms. 

## Your assignment

You are to continue analysis of this dataset in order to try to answer the client's
questions. Your goal is to communicate statistical conclusions clearly both
using appropriately chosen words and graphics.

The `hw3.Rmd` file in your team's repo is separated into 6 main sections: the three from last time plus (4)
Model selection/evaluation, (5) Final model/Inference, and (6) Conclusion. Each section has a number of points you should discuss, suggests graphics you should create, and  gives some code which may help to do certain tasks. You should address all of the 
points in some way or another. This may mean that you have to write a few paragraphs and
produce multiple figures for some points. Others you may consider to be ill-advised
given previous work. In such a case, you should say so and indicate why.

## Writing advice

Your language should be very clear and precise. Do not make claims for
which you have no evidence. Do not say "will" or "would" when you
really mean "may" or "might". Do not use language that implies
causation; you are studying associations between variables only. Move
away from wordy phrases (e.g: This is because, this is due to, the
reason that this is, this means that, I believe that this, I think the
reason is that). Make sure pronouns have clear referents ("these
results show" vs. "this shows").

Account for your audience. Interpret results in
the context of the problem. A statement like "The $p$-value is less
than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis" will receive no
credit. Instead say, "To determine whether the number of house
cats is a good predictor of hermit-ness, we examine the regression
coefficient. We see that this coefficient is very large, suggesting
that even a 1-cat increase predicts that the owner is more likely to be a
hermit. Furthermore, the associated $p$-value is very small indicating..."

## Grading rubric

```{r grade-vector, echo=FALSE}
a = c(4, 2, 4, 5, 10, 0)
ab_print <- function(pos, modify){
  a <- a
  b <- a[pos]
  c <- b + modify
  a[pos] <- c
  a <<- a
  paste0(c,' / ', b)
}
```

__Words__ (`r ab_print(1,0)`) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions
and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself
is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors,
divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and
sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge. 

__Numbers__ (`r ab_print(2,0)`) All numerical results or summaries are reported to
suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty
attached when applicable. 

__Pictures__ (`r ab_print(3,0)`) Figures and tables are easy to read, with
informative captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the
relevant pieces of text or referred to with convenient labels. 

__Code__ (`r ab_print(4,0)`) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy
for others to read and understand. It is indented, commented, and uses
meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually
needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code
borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is
explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or
procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests
which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of
the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. With regards to R Markdown,
all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only
relevant results are shown.

__Analysis__ (`r ab_print(5,0)`) Variables are examined
individually and bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with
appropriate figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the modeling
is clearly explained. The  model's
formulation is clearly related to the substantive questions of
interest. The model's assumptions are checked by means of appropriate
diagnostic plots or formal tests; if the model is re-formulated, the
changes are both well-motivated by the diagnostics, and still allow
the model to answer the original substantive question. Limitations
from un-fixable problems are clearly noted. The substantive questions about real estate
pricing are answered as precisely as the data and the model
allow. The chain of reasoning from estimation results about models, or
derived quantities, to substantive con- clusions is both clear and
convincing. Contingent answers (``if $X$, then $Y$, but if $Z$, then $W$'') are
likewise described as warranted by the model and data. If
uncertainties in the data and model mean the answers to some questions
must be imprecise, this too is reflected in the discussion. 

__Extra credit__ (`r ab_print(6,0)`) Up to five points may be awarded for reports
which are unusually well-written, where the code is unusually elegant,
where the analytical methods are unusually insightful, or where the
analysis goes beyond the required set of analytical questions.
